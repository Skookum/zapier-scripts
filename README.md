# Zapier Scripts

Various python scripts used in Skookum's Zapier account.

## Installation

Copy/Paste and configure input/output values as necessary for the specific use case you wish to leverage the script for.

The code should be added to "Code by Zapier" steps.


## Purpose

Justification for using custom python logic for specific zaps are to:
* Reduce number of steps (cost) that a Zap may have
* Interact with custom fields that may not exist in the approved platform zap (Hubspot APIs, Slack, etc)
